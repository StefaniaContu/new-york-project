            <h3>New York, the city of the five boroughs</h3>
            <p>
              As any local will tell you, NYC isn't just a single place, as you
              might expect with a smaller city. It can mean dozens of things! Do
              you want to head to Manhattan for a classic Empire State
              experience, perhaps looking to replicate the lifestyle you've seen
              on your favorite TV show? Or will you settle in Brooklyn, or maybe
              Queens? In all 5 boroughs of NYC, you've got a lot of choices! But
              don't worry, we'll help you narrow things down to find the best
              spot for you.
            </p>

              New York is made up of 5 major areas or “boroughs,” some separated
              by rivers and connected via ferry or bridge. So, what are the 5
              boroughs of New York? Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island,
              and The Bronx. Read on to find the right area for you.
